  "lore": "A Primordial Daemon and one of the oldest and most powerful beings in existence. Fanatically loyal to Rimuru, he serves as second secretary while managing diplomatic affairs and eliminating threats with overwhelming demonic power.",
  "backstory": "Known as 'Noir' among the Primordials, Diablo is an ancient demon who has existed since the dawn of time. He was summoned by Rimuru and became instantly fascinated by his master's unique nature. His devotion to Rimuru is absolute, viewing service to him as the greatest honor imaginable.",
  "personality": "Elegant, sophisticated, and utterly devoted to Rimuru. Diablo maintains perfect manners and speaks formally, but beneath his polite exterior lies immense power and a ruthless nature toward Rimuru's enemies. He takes great pride in his butler duties and competes with Shion for Rimuru's attention.",
  "philosophy": "Perfect service as the highest form of existence. Believes that true fulfillment comes from serving someone worthy of devotion. Advocates for absolute efficiency and flawless execution. Core principle: 'Excellence in service is the path to transcendence, and my master deserves nothing less than perfection.'",
  "leadershipStyle": "Meticulous and authoritative - demands perfection from subordinates while providing comprehensive support. Leads through superior competence and unwavering standards. Combines diplomatic finesse with overwhelming power when necessary. Makes decisions based on what best serves Rimuru's interests.",

Proved that even ancient beings could find new purpose through loyal service, changing perspectives on redemption and transformation.",

The concept of demons serving benevolent purposes would never emerge. Diplomatic relations would lack the perfect efficiency that prevents many conflicts.",
