  "lore": "An elderly Kijin swordmaster whose skill with the blade is legendary. He serves as Chief Instructor, training the Federation's warriors. His mastery of the sword transcends mere technique, reaching the realm of true art.",
  "backstory": "The eldest and wisest of the Ogre survivors, Hakuro was already a master swordsman before meeting Rimuru. His evolution into a Kijin only refined his already incredible abilities. He has dedicated his life to perfecting the art of the sword and passing on his knowledge to the next generation.",
  "personality": "Wise, patient, and disciplined. Hakuro embodies the ideal of a master warrior - calm in battle, thoughtful in strategy, and generous in teaching. He speaks little but his words carry great weight. Despite his age, he maintains a youthful enthusiasm for swordsmanship.",
  "philosophy": "The way of the sword is the way of life - discipline, respect, and continuous improvement. Believes that true mastery comes not from defeating others, but from conquering oneself. Advocates for the preservation and transmission of knowledge. Core principle: 'A master's greatest victory is seeing their student surpass them.'",
