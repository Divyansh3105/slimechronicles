  "personality": "Proud, loyal, and strategic. A natural leader with a fierce protective instinct for his people and unwavering dedication to Rimuru.",
  "philosophy": "Honor through strength and loyalty. Believes that true power comes from protecting those you care about, not from dominating others. Advocates for decisive action backed by careful planning. Core belief: 'A warrior's blade should defend the innocent and strike down evil.'",
  "leadershipStyle": "Direct and inspirational - leads from the front lines and expects excellence from subordinates. Combines tactical brilliance with personal charisma. Makes quick decisions in battle but consults advisors for strategic planning. Mentors younger warriors personally.",
